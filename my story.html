      <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Tasnim and I’m from Myanmar. Myanmar Is also called Burma and is located in Southeast Asia.
    There are more than 100 ethnic groups in Myanmar, including the Rohingya people.
    I am Rohingya.</p>
      <h1>Background:</h1>
        <p>Rohingya people are Muslim, but Myanmar is mostly Buddhist.
     The Buddhists living in Burma have been fighting the Rohingya since around 1940.
     Rohingya people are persecuted and oppressed by the Buddhist government and soldiers; they are killed and raped because we have different religious beliefs than the Burmese people in power.
     Right now in the news, it is being called ‘ethnic cleansing’ and ‘genocide.
     ’ The Burmese government has been destroying Rohingya villages, burning them to the ground, and murdering the inhabitants.
      Because of this, the Rohingya people have become poor and homeless.
      They don’t have any food, clothes, or shelter.
      To escape the Myanmar government, the Rohingya are trying to flee to Bangladesh before they are killed or die from starvation or disease.
      Since August 25, 600,000 (half a million) Rohingya have made it to Bangladesh, but many are also being killed along the way.
       I heard a story about a five year-old girl who was murdered by Burmese soldiers - my family was there when it happened.
       The things that are happening in Myanmar are terrible and it makes me really sad because innocent people are losing their lives and there’s nothing I can do about it.</p>
       <h1>Personal:</h1>
         <p>My family is very important to me because they have helped keep me safe, but they have not all been as lucky as I have. My father disappeared when I was two years old.
        I had five brothers, but one passed away because he was sick.
       The other four live in different countries - two are still in Myanmar with my grandparents, and the others are in Bangladesh and South Korea.
       However, some of my family was lucky enough to escape (my aunts, uncles, and cousins) and are living in Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, and the United States.
    When I was living in Myanmar, my brothers and I worked cleaning houses and fixing roads. I was very young but I had to work everyday.
    When I was 10 years old, I left Myanmar to go to Bangladesh, where I lived and worked in a foster home cooking and cleaning.
     After that, I went to India and worked with young children in a shelter, teaching them games and helping them to be happy.
     Next I moved to Thailand, where I also worked in the home cooking and cleaning.
     I left Thailand for Malaysia, and started working in a restaurant. From Malaysia, I was able to move to the United States - I arrived in 2016.
     I came to the United States to learn English and receive an education.
     Living in Myanmar, I never went to school, but here, I learned English in only a year.
     I have lived with two foster families - the current one I’ve been with since March 2017.
     My foster family has taken me on trips around the country; I’ve visited Oregon, Washington, San Diego, Los Angeles, and somewhere in the snow.
     I take dance classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays where I dance hip-hop.
     Sometimes I play soccer with my family and friends. I love to cook, especially spicy food and seafood.
     I feel so lucky to be here experiencing such a happy life surrounded by family and friends.</p>
  <h1>Conclusion:</h1>
      <p> Recently, Thailand and Malaysia have come forward saying that they will begin taking in refugees to help the Rohingya people.
  Between Bangladesh, Thailand, and Malaysia, there is some hope for the Rohingya fleeing Myanmar.
  However, it won’t be enough. America needs to help.
  We must stop the Burmese government from hurting Rohingya people.
I want to let you know that it is okay to ask me questions about my country and what is happening there.
 I feel better when I can talk to people about it, but I think sometimes people don’t know what to say to me or whether I want to talk.
 Right now I am trying to organize a fundraiser to send more money to my people, my family, and to their neighbors, so that they can buy food and try to escape.
 I am looking for people who might want to help me do it. If you want to help, don’t hesitate to ask - we can work together to help the Rohingya people.
